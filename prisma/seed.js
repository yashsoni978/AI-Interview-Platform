  summary:
    "Piyush demonstrated a solid understanding of React fundamentals and component architecture. He approached problems methodically and showed good instincts around state management. With some refinement in system design and async patterns, he's well on track for a mid-level frontend role.",
  technical:
    "Strong grasp of React hooks, component lifecycle, and basic TypeScript. Handled the closure question confidently. Struggled slightly with the event loop explanation and needed hints on optimising a recursive tree traversal — but recovered well once guided.",
  communication:
    "Articulate and structured in most answers. Thinks out loud effectively, which made it easy to follow his reasoning. Occasionally jumped to implementation before fully exploring the problem space.",
  problemSolving:
    "Good instinct for breaking problems down. Chose sensible data structures for most questions. The dynamic programming problem was a stretch — he identified the overlapping subproblems but didn't arrive at a memoised solution independently.",
  recommendation:
    "Recommended for mid-level frontend roles at growth-stage startups. Not yet ready for senior FAANG interviews without deepening system design knowledge. Suggest focusing on: async JavaScript internals, large-scale component architecture, and DP patterns.",
  strengths: [
    "Strong React & hooks knowledge",
    "Clear verbal communication",
    "Systematic debugging approach",
    "Good CSS & browser fundamentals",
  ],
  improvements: [
    "System design depth",
    "Async/event loop internals",
    "Dynamic programming patterns",
    "Ask clarifying questions upfront",
  ],
  overallRating: "GOOD", // POOR | AVERAGE | GOOD | EXCELLENT
  sessionRating: 4,
  sessionComment:
    "Great session — Piyush was engaged and receptive to feedback. Would be happy to interview him again after he's done more system design prep.",
